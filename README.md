# fortinet.fortios - Configuring FortiGate

## Description

The collection includes modules that allow users to configure FortiOS and FortiGate, specifically for managing firewall features.
Please refer to [Documentation](https://ansible-galaxy-fortios-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.15.0 or above
- Python 3.9 or above

## Installation
This collection is distributed via [ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install fortinet.fortios
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it with ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml, using the format:


```yaml
collections:
  - name: fortinet.fortios
```

Note that if you install any collections from Ansible Galaxy, they will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install fortinet.fortios --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version 2.3.7:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install fortinet.fortios:==2.3.9
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Use Cases

The FortiOS collection supports both username/password and access token authentication, with access tokens being the recommended method for enhanced security. For more infirmation about generating an access_token, please refer to [Generate access_token](https://ansible-galaxy-fortios-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#what-s-access-token).

Follow the example here [Examples](https://ansible-galaxy-fortios-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/playbook.html) to configure the hosts file and write your first playbook.

Change the FortiGate host name:
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Change hostname
    fortios_system_global:
      vdom:  "{{ vdom }}"
        system_global:
          hostname: 'YOUR_OWN_VALUE'
```

Run the playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook change_hostname.yml
```

## Testing

Testing is conducted by the Fortinet team. The new version will be released once the entire collection passes both unit and sanity tests.

## Support

Please open a Github issue if your have any questions [Report issues](https://github.com/fortinet-ansible-dev/ansible-galaxy-fortios-collection/issues)

## Release Notes and Roadmap

Refer to the release notes here [Release Notes](https://ansible-galaxy-fortios-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release.html)
The FortiOS Ansible collection is scheduled to be updated every two months.
