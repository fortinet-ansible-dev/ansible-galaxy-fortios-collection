module: fortios_switch_controller_managed_switch
short_description: Configure FortiSwitch devices that are managed by this FortiGate in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate.
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS (FOS) device by allowing the
      user to set and modify switch_controller feature and managed_switch category.
      Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage.
      Tested with FOS v6.0.0
version_added: "2.10"
