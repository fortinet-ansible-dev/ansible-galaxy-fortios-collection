module: fortios_router_multicast
short_description: Configure router multicast in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate.
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS (FOS) device by allowing the
      user to set and modify router feature and multicast category.
      Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage.
      Tested with FOS v6.0.0
version_added: "2.0.0"
