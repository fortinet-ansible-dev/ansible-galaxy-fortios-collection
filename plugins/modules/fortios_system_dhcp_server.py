module: fortios_system_dhcp_server
short_description: Configure DHCP servers in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate.
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS (FOS) device by allowing the
      user to set and modify system_dhcp feature and server category.
      Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage.
      Tested with FOS v6.0.0
version_added: "2.0.0"
