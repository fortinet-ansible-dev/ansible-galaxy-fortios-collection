module: fortios_firewall_profile_protocol_options
short_description: Configure protocol options in Fortinet's FortiOS and FortiGate.
description:
    - This module is able to configure a FortiGate or FortiOS (FOS) device by allowing the
      user to set and modify firewall feature and profile_protocol_options category.
      Examples include all parameters and values need to be adjusted to datasources before usage.
      Tested with FOS v6.0.0
version_added: "2.0.0"

notes:
    - Legacy fortiosapi has been deprecated, httpapi is the preferred way to run playbooks

    - The module supports check_mode.
